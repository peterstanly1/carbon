# Peter's User Manual 0.1

##Communication
I live in email and treat it like IM.  Please don’t be offended by brevity and terse emails.  
Please don’t call, text, or dm.  Email please.
Email is also my todo list. If we talk about something and you want me to do it please send me a reminder email.  
If you don’t hear back from me within a few days, bump the email thread.  I appreciate it a lot.  
I do my own scheduling and generally suck at it.  If we don’t set up a calendar invite there is a good chance I totally forget about it.  
I try to ignore my email on the weekends. Try being the operative word.  
I read all my Twitter DMs. I rarely respond. If you don’t know me, that is an ok way to reach out. If you are pitching, send me something to look at like a deck.
I practice double opt-in introductions unless it is an intro to someone truly amazing where the fit is perfect.  Please do the same for me.
I can be truly incompetent about trivial things. I am absent minded.
I work downtown Dallas.

##Meetings
I try to live by the Warren Buffet school of meetings and try to avoid having them.
You might find me rude if I refuse a meeting or ask to do it over email. Sorry. I am just trying to save us both wasted time.

##Investing
Ideas are meaningless.  Validated ideas are priceless.  
I generally invest in B2B or B2B2C companies.  I rarely do anything in consumer, but I occasionally break that rule.  Here is my portfolio. 
Please send me a deck, a summary or at least a paragraph first. I use these to make sure we are not wasting each other’s time.
I like weird ideas.  Please feel free to forward me anything as long as the founders are competent.
I spend the vast majority of my time looking at seed deals where I invest $200k-$1m, but I do invest into later stages where checks can be as much as $5m+.  
As an entrepreneur I pitched hundreds of investors. Much of that time was wasted. Now that I invest, I have made a commitment to come up with at least one idea (no promises it will be good) and or candid feedback for every entrepreneur I meet.
My favorite entrepreneurs are those that love being told how their baby is ugly and hearing ideas to make it better.  My least favorite take it personally.
I find that canned pitches don’t seem to work for me. Lets just have a conversation about your business.

##Personal
If I am a jerk, do something dumb or generally seem oblivious, please please please let me know. I often have no clue. Your feedback is priceless and I love it.  
If you have suggestions for this document please let me know so I can add them. It is a work in progress.
